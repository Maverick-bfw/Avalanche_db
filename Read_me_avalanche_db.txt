to make the avalanche data base "make_avalanche_db.py" needs to be edited and run.

The paths to files and folders below need to be set.

overview_html =       '/home/damboise/Documents/data_base/html/overview.html'
single_html =  '/home/damboise/Documents/data_base/html/single_avalanche/'
overview_csv  =       '/home/damboise/Documents/data_base/html/overview.csv'
avalanche_map_html = '/home/damboise/Documents/data_base/html/test_map.html'

after that the code is ready to run with python 2.7.

A pop up should open and you should pick what folder the input data is located.
